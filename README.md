<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Fork the repo, clone and begin your coding!

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. For the Repo
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HondaChan14/TailwindCSS-DaisyUI-EJS-Template.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your DB_STRING in `.env`
   ```js
   const DB_STRING = 'ENTER YOUR MONGODB CONNECTION STRING';
   const PORT = 'ENTER YOUR LOCALHOST PORT NUMBER'; EX: 2121
   ```
5. Followed the install instructions steps 1  from here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss

  A. Create your [postcss.config.js] file. Some reason it isn't made when installing postcss

  B. Then copy paste the 2nd Step box to [postcss.config.js]

  C. Then for ejs, you add to your contents section in your [tailwind.config.js]:
       "./views/**/*.ejs"

  D.  copy paste the fourth box into your style.css
      Then set up the main style.css in a src folder. (This is where you will add your CSS)
      
  E.  Then you go to your package.json and use this for the script
      "build-css": "tailwindcss -i src/style.css -o public/style.css --watch"
      (Doing this will link your src/style.css and create a public/style.css with TailwindCSS elements autocreated )
      Basically the Nodemon of Tailwind/DaisyUI. Watch at the end means that you only have to run it the one time and then every time you save a file it rebuilds the CSS and you don't have to keep restarting it

8.Run Both Nodemon and TailwindCSS-DaisyUI

```js
npm run dev in one Terminal for Nodemon
```
```js
npm run build-css in another Terminal to see TailwindCSS/DaisyUI updates
```
